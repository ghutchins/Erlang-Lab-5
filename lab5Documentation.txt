1.
	a) Non-recursively finding N^4, for any number N, is simply multiplying N by 
		itself 4 times (N*N*N*N).
		
	b) Square(N) computes N^2, and (N^2)*(N^2)= N^4, so square(N)*square(N) computes
		N^4.

	c) Median3 uses two comparisons to determine if the median is the first or second
		element in the tuple, else the true conditional returns the third element.
		The first conditional (if (A-B)*(C-A) >= 0) returns A because it indicates
		that either A >= B and A <= C or, that A <= B and A >= C, and both statements
		prove that A (the first element) is the median; the second conditional
		(if(B-A)*(C-B) >= 0) makes a similar comparison, but returns B as the median.

2.
	a) Factorial is recursive and returns 1 as the base case for N <= 1 (0! and 1! base cases).
		Else, N! is computed recursively using the equation N! = N*(N-1)!.

	b) If Nth item = 1, we return the current head of the list, else we call cycleOnce on the
		list, and then recursively call the function on this list until the Nth value is 
		the new head, at which point we return (using the base case).

	c) Bases cases handle 1) any X being raised to 0th power, since the answer will always
		be 1 (Y==1), and 2) any X being raised to the 1st power (X == Y). Recursive case
		calls function on Y/X and increments return by +1, so once Y/X == 1, the power of
		X that euqals Y will return.

	d) Base case handles a list with one item (empty tail), returns the head. Compare the 
		first two elements (head & head of the tail), if 1st > 2nd, push tail of the tail
		and the head onto a new list and recursively call function on that list (eliminates 
		smaller item from future comparisons). If the head is smaller, recursively call function
		on the tail elements -- when the tail is empty, the head will contain the largest 
		element.

	e) Base case handles empty list (input empty or recursive search did not find data item)
		(return false) and when data item is the head of the list (return true). If the
		data item N is not the head, call function on the tail of the list -- cycle through
		the list until data item is in the head (true), or it was never found (false).
